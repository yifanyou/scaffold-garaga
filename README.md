# Scaffold Garaga app

This is a Noir+Garaga+Starknet starter with in-browser proving and a step-by-step guide how to:
- Generate and deploy UltraHonk proof verifier contract to Starknet devnet
- Add state to your privacy preserving app
- Add wallet connection and deploy to public testnet

## Install

Ensure you have node.js >= 20 installed.  

Bun is used for package management, install it with:
```sh
make install-bun
```

For compiling Noir circuits and generating proofs we need specific versions of Aztec packages:
```sh
make install-noir
make install-barretenberg
```

Starknet toolkit comes in a single bundle via asdf (the following command will install it if you don't have it):
```sh
make install-starknet
```

We also need to install a tool for spawning local Starknet chain:
```sh
make install-devnet
```

Finally we need to install Garaga. Make sure you have Python 3.10 in your system. You may also need to start a separate Python virtual environment for this to work. You can do that with `python3.10 -m venv garaga-venv && source garaga-venv/bin/activate`. Then install with:

```sh
make install-garaga
```

Note that we need specific versions of Noir, Barretenberg, and Garaga to work well together. If you are experiencing any issues with code generation, proving, and verification — first of all ensure you have the correct package versions.

## Tutorial

This repo is organized in layers: each app iteration is a new git branch.  

Follow the steps and checkout the necessary branch:
1. [`master`](https://github.com/m-kus/scaffold-garaga/tree/master) — in-browser proof generation and stateless proof verification in devnet
2. [`1-app-logic`](https://github.com/m-kus/scaffold-garaga/tree/1-app-logic) — more involved Noir circuit logic
3. [`2-app-state`](https://github.com/m-kus/scaffold-garaga/tree/2-app-state) — extend onchain part with a storage for nullifiers
4. [`3-testnet`](https://github.com/m-kus/scaffold-garaga/tree/3-testnet) — deploy to public Starknet testnet and interact via wallet

## Run app

First of all we need to build our Noir circuit:

```sh
make build-circuit
```

Sample inputs are already provided in `Prover.toml`, execute to generate witness:

```sh
make exec-circuit
```

Generate verification key:

```sh
make gen-vk
```

Now we can generate the verifier contract in Cairo using Garaga:

```sh
make gen-verifier
```

Let's start our local development network in other terminal instance:

```sh
make devnet
```

You now need to start a new terminal window. Initialize the account we will be using for deployment:

```sh
make accounts-file
```

First we need to declare out contract ("upload" contract code):

```sh
make declare-verifier
```

Now we can instantiate the contract class we obtained (you might need to update the command in Makefile):

```sh
make deploy-verifier
```

Great! Now let's copy necessary artifacts:

```sh
make artifacts
```

Prepare the app and its requirements so you can run it. Go to the `app` folder and:
1. Update the contract address in the app code (change App.tsx). 
1. Make sure you have `tsc` installed. If not, you can install it with `bun add -d typescript@next`.
1. Install vite with `npm install -D vite`
1. Build the app with `bun run build`
1. Finally we can run the app: `bun run dev`
